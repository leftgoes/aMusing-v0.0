- programmatic animation of sheet music
  - notes appearing consecutively
  - uses [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) as notation software

*implemented* measures appearing consecutively

## Subdivision
*implemented* subdivsions of measure appearing consecutively

## ToDo
- doesn't hide tuplet numbers/brackets
  - don't know if possible using musicxml without hacks
- increase efficiency of making the score
  - OMR, e. g. [Audiveris](https://github.com/Audiveris)
